Currently I'm taking the MIT xPro Full Stack Developer bootcamp. 
  
  My end goal is to creating a powerful portfolio, and inorder to do that I'll be updating my Repository depending 
 on what projects I work on in class with MIT xPro. Keep in touch because this is nothing but a simple introduction
 to my future endavors.
