# Zzawadi.Projects.github.io
This repository is one that houses a portfolio that's filled with all my accomplishments and progress throughout my Coding Journey. 

## Currently, I'm taking the MIT xPro Full Stack Developer bootcamp. 
  The end goal is to create a powerful portfolio, and inorder to do that 
  I'll be updating my Repository depending on what projects I work on in class 
  with MIT xPro. In general, this is nothing but a simple introduction to my future
  endavors. 
 
 ### The Facts.
   I have completed 3 MIT projects, and each one increases in difficulty 
   since I'm encouraged to implement new types of style and standards of 
   coding within my programs.
   
   
 #### All Projects Are MIT Licenced!
